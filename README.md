## Data Curation Project

### Explanation

This is a project I did for my BYU Stat 386 class. Our task was to curate a data set by web scraping that we could use to answer questions of interest.

### Details

The English Premier League (EPL) is widely recognized as the top soccer (or football) league in the world. I am a huge fan of the EPL. One of the biggest events that happens each year in the EPL isn’t actually a game; rather, it is the transfer window (in other sports, this may be known as the trade deadline or trade window). One of the biggest talking points throughout the season is which players will get transferred to where.

My obsession with EPL has led me to wonder about how much the top players’ Estimated Transfer Values (ETVs) are, and also what teams they play for. I want to find the answers to the following questions:
1. What is the average ETV of the top 250 players in the league (measured by ETV)?
2. How many top 250 players does each team have?
3. What’s the correlation between skill and ETV?

In order to answer these questions, I will use data scraped from [this website] (https://www.footballtransfers.com/us/players/uk-premier-league).

### Contents of Repo

This repository contains the file I used to scrape the data using Selenium. It also contains a csv file of the data set after it was scraped.
